# vcf-parse-code

Output a table annotating each variant in the VCF input file. 
Each variant must be annotated with the following pieces of information:

1. Type of variation (Substitution, Insertion, Silent, Intergenic, etc.) If there are multiple
possibilities, annotate with the most deleterious possibility.
2. Depth of sequence coverage at the site of variation.
3. Number of reads supporting the variant.
4. Percentage of reads supporting the variant versus those supporting reference reads.
5. Allele frequency of variant from Broad Institute ExAC Project API
(API documentation is available here: http://exac.hms.harvard.edu/)
6. Additional optional information from ExAC that you feel might be relevant.
